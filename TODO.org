#+title: WorldBuild Progress

* Overview
Worldbuild repo is a collection of tools to manage worldbuild data and generate bulk lists from parameters.


** Goals
Notes on overall goals and current progress.

At the moment this repo is a collection of random scripts around Worldbuilding, many with simplistic algorithms.
Currently working on a combined interface (web_app running locally) to allow users to access the scripts and play around with the generators.

Also working on moving all the config and CSV files to a SQLite database.

*** Basic framework for worldbuild scripts

*** DONE Crafting
Supply a list of items, and recipes it can autocraft to determine quantities available.

**** TODO Crafting works, but needs to go to database

*** DONE Game Wiki
Basic wiki generated, though this needs to be improved

*** DONE NPC Generator
Generates random NPC stats

*** DONE Town Generator
Generates ultra simple town layout


*** DONE Dungeon Generator
Generates random text based Dungeon with path finding


*** TODO Event Generator
Generates random events- this works, but it is a bit simplistic


*** DONE Quest Generator
Generates random Quests 

**** TODO  basic framework only - needs work


*** DONE Quest World Generator
Generates random terrain

**** TODO Update terrain algorithm - too simple
Needs to be nested to make larger interesting maps


*** TODO Web app
Make sure to explain that this is NOT a nice safe web application suitable for
running publically - code is executed on local files so make damn sure they understand this.

Web app will have a nice interface to let users run all the scripts, save outputs, etc

**** DONE Basic Web app framework
Running the web app works well
Main areas are
- Home = start page (needs something here)
- Files = List of user created files
- Data = data tables loaded

**** TODO Web app should be able to publish to HTML and Mod flies

Will need to convert the old wiki page so it uses database tables instead

Also need to generate mod files (for import to UE4) or simple Javascript engine / Godot


**** DONE AutoLoad CSV files to Database


**** TODO new Tools to be added via Sep folders
instead of specifying tools via data table or config, they should be autoloaded when present in a /tools subfolder
