history: 
  - name: History of Alrona
    file: alrona_history.rst
  - overview: >
        Alrona is largely unknown due to an ancient war that wiped out
        all history and most of the people. There is no indication of 
        how this happened, but in the north there are sections of land
        haunted by spectres and ancient structures still stand built by
        unknown architecture.
        
        It is assumed the scattered survivors began to rebuilt further 
        south, and most of the major cities and documents have a history
        here.
terrain: 
  - name: Sharnia 
    coords_x_y: [50,50]
    desc: >
        The central continent Sharnia is where most of the people live - it 
        is mostly green forest, with several mountain ranges.
    major_cities: ['Draeton', 'Cilton', 'Doctade']
  - name: Zinad
    coords_x_y: [10,10]
    major_cities: ['Landel', 'Asint', 'Hem']
    desc: >
        Zinad is the Elvish continent in the north west, a lush green land well
        protected by high cliffs 
  - name: Helron
    coords_x_y: [80,20]
    major_cities: []
    desc: >
        Helron is the Northern continent which mostly untravelled due to the harsh
        climate and frequent accounts of spectres and dragons - it is wet and mountainous
        but little grows there. Some tests have shown poison in the soils further inland 
        and it is assumed this contributed to the downfall of the people in the ancient war.
  - name: Evanite
    coords_x_y: [90,80]
    major_cities: []
    desc: >
        Evanite is home of the Drans, and has no fixed settlements. It is an unnavigable series of jagged islands with the large river "Spline" running up the Eastern wing. Permanent cloud covers the land, make most areas dark and uninviting.
        
animals: 
  - name: Fawps
    desc: >
        A chicken like bird abundantly bred, and occasionally found wild this 
        is once of the primary sources of food for all races.
  - name: Nujla
    desc: >
        Nujlas are herbivores and grow to over 15 feet long. The meat is a 
        deliciously and they are hunted on occasion (they are quite dangerous)
  - name: Flikz
    desc: >
        Flikz are small but dangerous creatures that hunt in packs. They can 
        take down a warrior when in packs of 5 due to the mild poison on 
        their fangs.
        They are common in plains and wooded areas, preferring warmer climates.
  - name: Razan
    desc: >
        Razan are monstrous fish like animals with caterpillar legs that can survive for weeks on land. They eat anything and everything and usually destroy an environment or town if left unchecked to breed. 
        They now only live in the remote islands of alrona, mainly because they were wiped out completely in the mainland continents Sharnia and Zinad.
        
  - name: Dragon
    desc: >
        Dragons are mostly legendary as no survivors have returned from Helrom, but there suspicion they likely exist due to large fast airborne attacks on some northern communities
