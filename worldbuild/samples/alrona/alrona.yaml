history: 
  - name: History of Alrona
    file: alrona_history.rst
    desc: >
        Alrona is largely unknown due to an ancient war that wiped out
        all history and most of the people. There is no indication of 
        how this happened, but in the north there are sections of land
        haunted by spectres and ancient structures still stand built by
        unknown architecture.
        
        It is assumed the scattered survivors began to rebuilt further 
        south, and most of the major cities and documents have a history
        here.

        climate and frequent accounts of spectres and dragons - it is wet and mountainous
