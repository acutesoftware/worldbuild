============================================
Legend of the Ancient Annihilation in Alrona
============================================

Summary
------------------
Alrona is largely unknown due to an ancient war that wiped out
all history and most of the people. There is no indication of 
how this happened, but in the north there are sections of land
haunted by spectres and ancient structures still stand built by
unknown architecture.

It is assumed the scattered survivors began to rebuilt further 
south, and most of the major cities and documents have a history
here.
