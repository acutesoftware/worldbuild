Legend of the Ancient Annihilation in Alrona
============================================

Summary
=======================================================================
Alrona is largely unknown due to an ancient war that wiped out all history and most of the people. There is no indication of how this happened, but in the north there are sections of land haunted by spectres and ancient structures still stand built by unknown architecture.

It is assumed the scattered survivors began to rebuilt further south, and most of the major cities and documents have a history here.
