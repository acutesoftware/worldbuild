History of Alrona
============================================

Summary
=======================================================================
Alrona is largely unknown due to an ancient war that wiped out all history and most of the people. There is no indication of how this happened, but in the north there are sections of land
haunted by spectres and ancient structures still stand built by unknown architecture.

It is assumed the scattered survivors began to rebuilt further south, and most of the major cities and documents have a history here.

Origin and First Age
=======================================================================
No actual human history is available before the 2nd age - answers may lay in the ancient ruins in Helron, where old cities and technologies lay in dust, obviously from the First age. The complete lack of documentation from this era indicates something went awry in a catastrophic way.

There are some examples of First age structures in Zinad and on some of the larger islands but the bulk appears to be on Helron as discovered by the Journal washed up on shore. (see `story_no_escape_from_helron.rst` ) 


Second Age (2000-2950 [current])
=======================================================================
Elves came to at the start of the 2nd age, in response to the catastrophic event - they had no indication of what the event was, only that a massive wipeout of life on an entire world had occurred.

When they arrived there was no life on Zinad so they slowly populated the stocks and animal life themselves.

Humans appeared to have repopulated from tiny pockets of survivors on distant islands or deep caves, and they merged to Sharnia to start over there.

Drans appeared late in the 2nd ages, on the south east islands, but it was later discovered they have been living in Helron since the start of the 2nd age. They were probably humans from the first age that survived the event and mutated into what are now Drans (half spirit but have taken dead corpses and evolved into a wraith like warrior than can attack (and die) as a normal human.
