<BR>Legend of the Ancient Annihilation in Alrona
<BR>============================================
<BR>
<BR>Summary
<BR>=======================================================================
<BR>Alrona is largely unknown due to an ancient war that wiped out all history and most of the people. There is no indication of how this happened, but in the north there are sections of land haunted by spectres and ancient structures still stand built by unknown architecture.
<BR>
<BR>It is assumed the scattered survivors began to rebuilt further south, and most of the major cities and documents have a history here.
<BR>
<BR>Notable Lack of History from First Age
<BR>============================================================================
<BR>There is no written human history from the first age, yet pockets of humans lived around Alrona and eventually settled in Sharnia. The Elves arrived during this time, in response "to a catastrophic event" yet they did not interfere with the humans in the early first age.
<BR>
<BR>Damage discovered in digs and ruins
<BR>============================================================================
<BR>The massive ancient structures that lie around the Northern areas of Sharnia (and some in Helron) prove that there was a civilisation in earlier times though no records or information can be found on them.
<BR>
<BR>Even more interesting is the damage done to some of them - there are solid stone structures which have been split asunder by some massive force or explosion (which no one in currently can reproduce).
<BR>
<BR>Botanical Changes
<BR>============================================================================
<BR>Several plant species have grown on the North regions in Sharnia that are believed to have originated from Helron.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Emergence of the Drans
<BR>============================================================================
<BR>The Drans appeared sometime in the first age, and are a combination of an undead spirit living in a human body.
