They are dangerous though will not attack randomly, tending to wait until they have the numbers to overcome their prey - it is for this reason that if you see a wolf, you need to be concerned.
</p><BR><HR><h2>Flikz</h2><p>Flikz are small but dangerous creatures that hunt in packs. They can  take down a warrior when in packs of 5 due to the mild poison on  their fangs. They are common in plains and wooded areas, preferring warmer climates.

They have 6 small legs, but usually slither along the ground as they foriage for flowers and other plants to eat. They can fly reasonable distances using their 8 wings along their thin golden body. It is widely assumed that they are an ancient creature, as though they dont communicate with other races - they have no enemies, keep to themselves and seem to have a very long lifespan.

They eat anything and everything and usually destroy an environment or town if left unchecked to breed.  They now only live in the remote islands of alrona, mainly because they were wiped out completely in the mainland continents Sharnia and Zinad.
