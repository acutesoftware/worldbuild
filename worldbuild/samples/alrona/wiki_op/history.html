<BR>History of Alrona
<BR>============================================
<BR>
<BR>Summary
<BR>=======================================================================
<BR>The origin of Alrona is largely unknown due to an ancient war that wiped out all history and most of the people. There is no indication of how this happened, but in the north there are sections of land haunted by spectres and ancient structures still stand built by unknown architecture.
<BR>
<BR>It is assumed the scattered survivors began to rebuilt further south, and most of the major cities and documents have a history here.
<BR>
<BR>Origin and First Age
<BR>=======================================================================
<BR>No actual human history is available before the 2nd age - answers may lay in the ancient ruins in Helron, where old cities and technologies lay in dust, obviously from the First age. The complete lack of documentation from this era indicates something went awry in a catastrophic way.
<BR>
<BR>There are some examples of First age structures in Zinad and on some of the larger islands but the bulk appears to be on Helron as discovered by the Journal washed up on shore. (see `story_no_escape_from_helron.rst` ) 
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Second Age (2000-2950 [current])
<BR>=======================================================================
<BR>Elves came to at the start of the 2nd age, in response to the catastrophic event - they had no indication of what the event was, only that a massive wipeout of life on an entire world had occurred.
<BR>
<BR>When they arrived there was no life on Zinad so they slowly populated the stocks and animal life themselves.
<BR>
<BR>Humans appeared to have repopulated from tiny pockets of survivors on distant islands or deep caves, and they merged to Sharnia to start over there.
<BR>
<BR>Drans appeared late in the 2nd ages, on the south east islands, but it was later discovered they have been living in Helron since the start of the 2nd age. They were probably humans from the first age that survived the event and mutated into what are now Drans (half spirit but have taken dead corpses and evolved into a wraith like warrior than can attack (and die) as a normal human.
<BR>
<BR>The Kandagor race are believed to be direct living descendants of the old people who survived the event - they lived unknown to other races, and survived deep in the caves of Helron for thousands of years - learning and training to be better and more just warriors. The Kandagor have a memory of what happened and will not yield to propaganda in order to fight. A strongly trained rationality and bias awareness program is instilled in all Kandagorians, with the emphasis on "why am I doing this" and "think" before reacting.
<BR>
<BR>Though thoughtful in mind and spirit, once engaged the Kandagor are the fastest, most dangerous creature to fight, as their skills are supremely honed with centuries of training and refined techniques. A single Kandagorian can easily take out a squad of Humans or Elves and almost unlimited Drans.
