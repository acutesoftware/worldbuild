No Escape From Helron
=======================
In the 3rd age of Alrona a journal was discovered in a trunk from the stomach of a large Razan found dead near the shores of Sharnia. It was analysed by scholars and translated below.

2302-1: Setting off
------------------------
Our crew are eager and excited to explore the unknown Northern lands, though some are understandably nervous. No one, to our knowledge has attempted such a journey and we are fitting out our crew with full battle gear and all manner of supplies.

2302-4: Navigating the typhoons
------------------------------------
The sea trip was terrifying - never have I seen so many typhoons at one time. As soon as one passed there is another to content with. The ships crew did not rest for 27 hours as they navigated through the treacherous seas.

2302-8: Arrival at the shore
------------------------------------
On arrival at the south shore of Helron we docked not far, though not close to the shore and rested a day to check supplies, repair damage, etc in case we needed a fast get away.
Looking to the shores it has an eerie fog like cloud over the centre of the land - I had to clean my glasses twice before I realised it was real.

2302-9: Initial Scout of surrounding land
----------------------------------------------
The land is not at all pleasant, yet has a haunting, lost desolation that is quite beautiful in an odd way. We have yet to spot a bird, animal or insect, so we are lucky we bought complete set of supplies, including water as the water in the rivers here taste like acid.

The vegetation at our landing point in the south is similar to Sharnia, though there is a noticeable stuntedness to growth across everything from trees to the grass.

There is no life in the water, not even fungus and ironically this makes the water utterly clear and quite beautiful. One of the digging crew forgot the warning and jumped in to cool off, but quickly jumped out with what looked like mild sunburn on his entire body, much to the amusement of the rest of the crew.

2302-12: Discovery of the Helron Cave
-------------------------------------
The camp is quite excited as we discovered a cave system today and the initial reports say it leads to massive underground series of halls all linked with additional tunnels going off to who knows where. We will prepare an expedition tomorrow.

2302-13: Ghouls Attack
----------------------------------------------
A strongly armed team went into the cave early in the morning and explored 2 of the tunnels but were attacked by some form of ghouls - most died and only 2 returned to base camp. They were tii terrified to provide much detail, though did say there was something 'big' living there as well as the ghouls.

As we tended to the wounded and prepared for a rescue of any survivors, the normally deathly silent land was alive with many strange noises but no direct confrontation occurred.

2303-14: Retreat
----------------------------------------------
We cannot go on and risk further loss of life - the Captain has said to abandon the lost so that we may return and tell the tale, but I am deathly afraid - I wish I had never come to this hateful, ghostly land.

4 of the remaining 7 are on night watch while us 3 are resting, but there is no way I will sleep another second here.

I must have dozed off, because I wake suddenly to the sound of horrified screams. The sun is just rising so I went to wake the other 2 but no one else is in the tent. It is now deathly silent and I am sitting here waiting for something. Did they leave without me?

I am utterly terrified - it has been an hour and not a single noise is out there, I have packed my belongings and am ready to go. It is so quiet. The sun has risen fully revealing another foggy looking day in this land, but there is no sign of life as I peep through the tent.

A noise at last! Are they back? No, it turns out to be a large animal walking through the camp rummaging through the supplies and tents - I see it looks like a giant fish but has many legs - it is over 20 feet long. As soon as it is over the other side, I am going to make a run for the boat.
