history: >
    Alrona is largely unknown due to an ancient war that wiped out
    all history and most of the people. There is no indication of 
    how this happened, but in the north there are sections of land
    haunted by spectres and ancient structures still stand built by
    unknown architecture.
    
    It is assumed the scattered survivors began to rebuilt further 
    south, and most of the major cities and documents have a history
    here.

    - Sharnia: >
        The central continent Sharnia is where most of the people live - it 
        is mostly green forest, which several mountain ranges.
    
    - Zinad: >

        protected by high cliffs 
    
    - Helron: >
        Helron is the Northern continent which mostly untravelled due to the harsh
        climate and frequent accounts of spectres and dragons - it is wet and mountainous
        but little grows there. Some tests have shown poison in the soils further inland 
        and it is assumed this contributed to the downfall of the people in the ancient war.

    Chickens - abundantly bred, and occasionally wild this is a primary source of food
    Pigs - rich people enjoy this meat as breeding them is dangerous (they grow to 15 feet)

    take down a warrior when in packs of 5 due to the mild poison on their fangs

    they exist due to large fast airborne attacks on some northern communities
