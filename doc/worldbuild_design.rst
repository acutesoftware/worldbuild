[testing]     = key parts developed, testing results

[completed]   = tests passed and contents copied to users manual / ext paper

Map Annotation
-------------------
The JPG image of the map has coordinates entered as a ration of width and height, rather than pixels otherwise resizing images will lose the reference points.
