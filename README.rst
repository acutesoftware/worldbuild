World Build
=========================================

    
(Planning) Tools for computational world building

Proposal / Overview
--------------------------------
This package currently only has the planet terrain code previously from VAIS.

It will contain tools to build worlds and store the metadata around that, including objects, history, animals, vegetation

This is NOT a true rendered 3d representation of a world, rather a macro level world builder for hobbyists and gamers.

It will allow scanning of world maps, and storage of the history of the world. Text and image only - NOT 3d rendered


Tools
=========================================

World Overview
-------------------------------
Has tools and wizards to guide you to give as much or as little detail as you want - this is the meta data of the world and will be helpful for later auto implementation
Custom Wiki Generation

auto read text files into appropriate areas

Terrain Generation
-------------------------------
Free form
You can draw lines and place down land / vegetation etc in a gui (best if it is javascript rather than TKinter)

Random Generation (done - in progress at least)
Use planet.py to create a random planet
Should also allow modifying and saving to proper data format with layers for plants, etc

Scan from picture
Takes an image of a scanned map and extracts the content into multiple layers based on image clustering like hills and trees.  Users can tweak how it converts.


data storage of content around world (like a notepad / wiki)

Object builder
-------------------------------
Remember you start simple with a name and some stats and can them flesh out details with images icons for map right up to 3d blender models or sgi cad models.

Creature Builder
-------------------------------
specify creatures 
simple = rogue specs + icon for moving on 2d map
complex = armour and weapon tables like wow - basic image
path finding - send AIâ€™s around your world to map paths
